Looking for a haunted house to stay in this Halloween? Try this responsive Airbnb clone built with TypeScript, Next.js, Tailwind, Heroicons, Mapbox and react-date-range.

This project was mostly an exercise in front end design, containing very little functionality. Typing in the search bar triggers a dropdown date picker; if you select a date range, a number of guests and then click search, you're taken to search 'results' for the data you submitted (extracted from the URL with useRouter queries). The data, which I'm storing on Json Keeper, will be the same every time.

Try it here: [https://scarebnb-nine.vercel.app/](https://scarebnb-nine.vercel.app/)

With more time I would like to develop this into a full-stack project with the following features:

* User registration/authentication
* Customisable user profile
* List properties
* Submit, accept and manage bookings
* Leave reviews
* PayPal/Stripe integration
